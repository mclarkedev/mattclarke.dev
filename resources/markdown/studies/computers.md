Title: How to interact with computers

# How to interact with computers

It's 1965 and you've just been shown ELIZA, an early artificial intelligence program that can chat with you. You've never seen or used a chat bot before. What would you think of it?

ELIZA's creator, Joseph Wiezenbaum, would say that you'd perceive it all too human. In fact, you'd find it so intimate that you'd have very personal conversations with it.

"What I had not realized is that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people."

For Wiezenbaum, strong intimate experiences with computers were possible not due to the brilliance of his program but the nature of its end user. We crave intimacy and are willing to ignore the truth to get it. Often, we distort our own perception to fit patterns we already know.

I'll always remember, when launching an art recommendation feature at Arthur, that users assumed our prototype worked like magic: it intelligently understood their interests.

When interviewed, most users assumed the algorithm intelligently understood their tastes. In truth, we were just showing people random artworks. But most users of computer programs assume that something very complex and intelligent is happening under the hood, even when its not.

I used a computer like this for a very long time. At 14, I was using obscure technical programs like MAX, but never once thought my passion for computers should spill over into the domains of raw text or good hacking. I feel most people use computers this way.

Perhaps, using a computer is nebulous within itself. We use software. We browse the web, create things, message friends and colleagues and so on; computers have seemingly infinite use cases.
