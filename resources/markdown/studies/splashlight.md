# Splashlight Website

## User Story

As a creative at a large retail brand, I need to understand how Splashlight's technology works in order to **assess the benefits of Splashlight's product suite**.

## Design Prompt

So, as a design team we asked, how might we describe the benefits of Splashlight's product suite so that website users get in touch to learn more?
