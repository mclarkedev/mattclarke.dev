###### â˜‰ Case Study

# Selling Products Online

Selling products online is hard. Particularly in fashion, where purchasing clothes is just downright too complex.

That's just user journey. The service delivery requires most literally a Six Sigma black-belt to understand. Balancing the logistics and creative can be tricky for large e-commerce retailers. Struggling to get the balance right, businesses partner with [Splashlight](https://www.splashlight.com) to shoot high-volume creative assets on tight seasonal deadlines.

Splaslight offers niche advantages such as the tagging and monitoring of creative assets. Currently, creative teams wait full business cycles before reviewing the performance of new styles, visual communication, and branding. They often require data and engineering teams to answer basic questions. With Splashlight's software, creatives teams can take ownership of analyzing, inspecting, and understanding data.
