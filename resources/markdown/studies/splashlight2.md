Title: Selling Products Online

# Selling Products Online

Selling products online is hard. Particularly in fashion, where purchasing clothes is just much harder.

"Will it fit me? Is it itchy? My card isn't stored on here? But they have the same style for half off? I don't want this anymore..."

And that's just user journey. The service delivery requires most literally a Six Sigma black-belt to understand. Balancing the logistics and creative can be tricky at high-volume. Struggling to get the balance right, large e-commerce retailers partner with Splashlight to shoot high-volume creative assets on seasonal deadlines.

SplashTag helps creatives match model and photography attributes to web users.

I joined Splashlight to help package and launch their production technology to large retail brands such as Target and Under Armour. In addition to project management and design coordination, I designed their new website and guided the go-to-market strategy for their analytics solution.

A few user-experience basics helped along the way:
