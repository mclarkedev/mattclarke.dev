Title: Early-stage Startup Culture

# Early-stage Startup Culture

### How to manage small teams with high expectations.

Startups have high expectations by default. And its no secret this causes strife. If you’ve ever seen Survivor, then you’re likely familiar with the difficulties of aligning a new team. While the game is wholely different, working at an early-stage startup can sometimes feel as competative, dramatic, and confusing. Whether you’re blind-sighted by a new strategy, or the one doing the blind-sighting, alliances form based on both how and what the team should build.

In my experience, the how alliances are the most dangerous. As a product generalist, I’ve found myself in the midst of many how discussions.

In a how alliance, you’re always fighting an up-hill battle. To change how a team does something not only requires support from management but also your peers. It also requires that 1. people are open to discuss how you currently build product. If you don’t have a forum to dicusss how you’ll build, then you’re going to have how alliances. And the more diverse your team is, then the stronger each alliance will be.

Most contributors I’ve worked with are eager to help build others ideas, even if they don’t anticipate an outcome. But when groups form differing opinions on the trade-offs needed to be successful they begin to polarize in secrecy.

New teams working with high expectations should bake their stressors into how they build product.

As a product designer and developer, I’ve delivered a range of assets and have become quite paticular in how they should be stacked and shipped. While I’m no expert in startups, and not a founder by any means, this has put me in a unique position to see the stressors that impact everyone on the team.

The root stressor is quite simple and well known. Its not fun to build something people don’t use. This trickles into everything, everyone does. No one can avoid it. If you’ve worked at a pre-revenue startup and you don’t relate to this, there’s an easy reason why. You’re there for the money (or for the people).

It should bother everyone if your app lacks engagement. And it should bother you even more if you can’t figure out if anyone is using the feature you’ve built. So, how can teams overcome being so bothered all the time?

The best justification for not caring about user engagement is the optimism of a mission-driven product. If you aren’t measuring and discussing engagement daily, you’re likely amping up your team with optimism. “I feel great about this last release, how about you?”.

As a team lead, I’m surely at fault for empty optimism. But I fear my actual alliance is with the dooms-day tribe. The dooms-day tribe is a result of empty optimism.

In larger logistically driven teams, this is not an issue. Employees do as their told regardless if it provides value to the company.

Complexity budget.

In organically formed startups, you’re likely there for the people and already have a culture. In other startups

If you care about technology and providing value to your team, you’ll likely find yourself frustrated with how or what your building product. For many just getting into startups, there’s a tremendous reward of contributing real value to a product. I’ve worked the hardest I can work for startups and startups alone. I’ve learned, built, and launched entirely new development systems over the course of a single week––something I find much harder to do without a team pushing eachother along.
