Title: Finding Art You Love

# Finding Art You Love

### Reflections on my experience shipping art browsing features at Arthur.

Keeping up with contemporary art can be taxing. Its rank with eye rolls, over-hyped projects, lots of information, scams and fraud. In the occasion you find something you love, it can feel like the haze appears again and again whenever you dig deeper.

In a time where art can be anything or nothing, the issue seems to multiply as art-curious users search for rabbitholes and influence aesthetics at scale. With more and more NFT art markets launching online, the tension between old and new markets has steeped a very real cultural debate. The zeitgiest feels more hostile than ever.

No matter where you stand, you’re likeling going to have an aesthetic itch to scratch from time to time. So, how do you find it? How do you sustain finding it in a rapidly changing landscape? While I’m certainly biased––having worked in art publishing––I’ve always found solace in used art book stores. I can’t always get myself there, but when I do my experience is far more memorable than sifting through online grift.

Books are far simpler than computers. Their content is consistent over time. And when arranged by a store owner that lets the shelves fade into time, the browsing experience can be extremely consistent as well. Simplicity and consistency over time can emensely help users discover value over and over again.

But book stores aren’t easy to get to. They close often and require that you actually open books. While I wish I could open all the books, cutout the images, I would quickly burnout of energy and cash.

Browsing content online is easy. Its immediately availible, abundant, and highly marketed. But browsing content online can be far from simple. What do I do with what I like? How do I get more of the similar thing? How can I more freely explore, have some sense of where I am, and where I am going?

I joined Arthur, in the height of the pandemic, to help people keep up with contemporary art. In the beggining, we were convinced users needed something that didn’t exsist anywhere: a personalized art feed. Because... well, we wanted a personalized feed. A mobile feed that kept us up to date about the locus of information we cared about: local galleries, remote galleries, living artists, deceased artists, and market activity. A range of content simplified by time.

It turns out, time can’t simplify everything. With too many types of content, interlaced and competing for attention, we had the same issue we started with. Browsing content online is complex and annoying. We seemed to fall for the age old startup addage: ‘This’ but social media!

Part of the reason powerhouse social media apps work is because the content and source is simple. The more types of content or sources you add, the wider the range of user expectations and more opprotunity for confusion. Hence, you probably need an activity stream.

So, we wondered, what type of simple user generated content can help us here? What tool could help people tell stories about art? We started working more closely with independent curators to learn how they work. Quickly enough, I found myself prototyping a web editor that let curators use the art data we had gathered in long form.

It allows for a wide range of structured data to be written about in-line. It also follows the form of magazine and books, where a real persons voice ties everything together. Sure, it’s not mobile and real-time. But is the start of an innovation of the current systems where editors are hired in-house and push content as SEO to fuel other services, adding further complexity for users to sift through. In our model, we hoped, the editor and content was good enough to be the service itself.

As proud as I was of the UX, borrowed and blended from Notion, Mirror, and Zora, there was a fatal flaw. Manually gathering the data to fuel it was difficult. The curators didn’t want to do it themselves and our data team found it taxing to get exactly what the curators requested. We had arrive back at complexity. Surely, there must be something more fun.

One feature I think solves for this complexity is image search. Can I find more art I love just by taking a photo of things I love?

Visual search enabled me to find David Dourad from a photo of my window, a place thats rather special to me. While there certainly are use cases for structured art data, the dynamic approach to finding art seems far more valuable. But we only got here as a team by first testing multiple options and prototypes.

What I like most about visual search isn’t that the output approximately matches my input, its the simplicity in surfacing content. Suddenly, I feel like I have all the art books at my disposal and all I have to do is snap an image to access them.
