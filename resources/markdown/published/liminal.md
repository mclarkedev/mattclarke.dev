Liminal is a personal media library for the web. Designed for creatives, researchers, and curious people, it’s mission is to make researching and collecting the web more reliable, secure, and extensible.

With core feature support for RSS feeds, YouTube media activity, bookmarking, and browser history storage, Liminal provides complete data access to a single timeline of your media consumption––allowing you to track a single topic across a range of sources. Built-in knowledge services, such as a structured data inspector and Wikipedia API, allow you to quickly store and discover commonly known people, places, and things.

Product concept, mobile interface design, desktop interface design, and cross-platform full-stack development.
