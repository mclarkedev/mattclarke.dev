# Splashlight Website

![A web prototype.](/videos/splashlight-web.mp4)

[Splashlight Studios](https://splashlight.com/) specializes in high-volume and high-quality creative photography production. I joined Splashlight to help package and launch their production pipeline technology to large retail brands such as Target and Under Armour. In addition to project management and design coordination, I designed their new website and guided the go-to-market strategy for their analytics solution.

A few user-experience basics helped along the way:
