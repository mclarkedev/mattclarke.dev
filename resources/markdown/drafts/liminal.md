![A prototype of a web application.](/videos/liminal.mp4 "A prototype of a web application.")

I started Liminal in 2020 to organize my research topics and daily media consumption.

Designed for creatives, researchers, and curious people, it’s mission is to make collecting web media more reliable, secure, and extensible.

With core feature support for RSS feeds, YouTube media activity, bookmarking, and browser history storage, Liminal provides complete data access to a single timeline of your media consumption––allowing you to track a single topic across a range of sources. Built-in knowledge services, such as a structured data inspector and Wikipedia API, allow you to quickly store and discover commonly known people, places, and things.
