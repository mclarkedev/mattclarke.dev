Title: Clojure for Designers

# Clojure for Designers

```clojure
(build-site! (get-markdown-data)) => "Success. Site built!"
```

## Why Clojure?

As a designer learning to code, I'd suspect Clojure isn't high on your list to learn. I mean, why should it? Designers have a majority stake in user interactions, not backend systems. We're also highly invested in rapid-prototyping; whatever gets the job done to convince the user. We really shouldn't invest ourselves in language design, let alone a LISP language popularized by academics. Let's leave that to the engineers, computer scientists, the real hackers. Or should we?

Every designer who claims they can code should learn a LISP for a very simple reason. It's good design. Any plea for convenience can't beat good design in the long run. It'd be convenient for companies to just not hire designers, to have engineers solve those issues. Good designers should care about the design of their actually products as well as their experienced product.

Designers are highly-skilled in creating systems that can't be built, or that are just too noisy. We like to contribute fancy things to specifications. Need a plug-and-play parallax scroll, infinite scroll, or isomorphic full stack web development framework? You can prototype it all yourself and build real things fast with Node, right now. It's so easy that you can even use Node without knowing that you're using Node.

But easy doesn't equal simple. Designers who recite their Dieter Rams principles before bed understand that the simplest things are often the hardest. Clojure is Simple Made Easy, the spirit of true design.

## Building something

Clojure is a LISP. (New to programming? Checkout Scheme and SICP). LISPs look like this:

```
;; Define a variable
(def config {:author 'Matthew Clarke' })

;; Run a function
(build-website config)

```

## Fast tutorial

### Make your project

In the spirit of simple > easy, we're not using a build system, or any template for our project.

```shell
mkdir mattclarke.dev

cd mattclarke.dev

echo "# mattclarke.dev" >> README.md

git init

```

### Open your project

I use VSCODE + Calva

### Define your project

[See initial commit]

```

```

### Setup Clojure project

Enabling awesome features fast is great right now, but it surely isn't design, its a convenience. When we reach for designer-friendly features we forgo design. And when we constantly forgo design, we forgo thinking for ourselves. Guess what designer, you can think for yourself.

The Node ecosystem has powered one of the largest developer communities in history.

And we perceive this as our value on a team, because we've been told that's why we were hired. This can be a wide awakening for some that are reciting their Dieter Rams principles before bed.

In a software culture of 'do things that don't scale'. It's easy for designers to accept that their programs shouldn't scale, so we learn to build in these extremely

You should learn Clojure if you're interested in what's actually at stake with computing.

(try Scheme here first)
