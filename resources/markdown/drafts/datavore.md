Title: Helping analysts sift through big data

# Helping analysts sift through big data

Datavore is a code-free data platform for advanced time series analysis. It was built for analysts and data scientists to efficiently track indicators across datasets in order to validate and backtest data signals from a wide-range of sources, timelines, and strengths.

Joining the team in 2019, I helped extend the core product to include granular data tagging, a feature that allows analysts to segment and deploy reports for big, real-time datasets. This provides a unique opportunity for data providers and customers to test hypotheses without exchanging raw datasets. It also allieviates security concerns from consumers and businesses over personal identity tracing in anonymized datasets––setting a hopeful, optimistic standard for an era of wild-west data exchanges.

As Design Lead on a 4 person development team, I took a highly iterative approach to the design process. We updated the client interfaces with weekly deploys and prioritized user feedback from analysts and early-adopters at daily standup meetings.
